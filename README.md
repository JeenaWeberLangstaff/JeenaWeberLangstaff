My name is Jeena Weber Langstaff. I was born in Northern India and lived there for two years. I moved to Switzerland and lived there for seven years. In July of 2007, my family moved to Rhode Island, and we have been here ever since. I graduated in 2021 with a Bachelor's degree from Goucher College in business management with a concentration in international business. I am currently majoring in computer science and psychology at the University of Rhode Island.
